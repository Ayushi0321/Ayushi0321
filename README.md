##### 👋 Hi, my name is Ayushi!

##### 🎓  I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Western Michigan University, where I also pursued minors in Business Analytics & Data Science. My educational journey has been about more than just coursework; it's been a quest to expand my skill set and sharpen my analytical abilities. 

##### 📚  During my academic years, I delved into a range of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and Java. I built interactive data visualizations using tools like MS Excel and MS PowerBI. Additionally, I honed my data manipulation skills with databases like MySQL, MS SQL, and MongoDB. 

##### 💻 Currently, I'm putting my knowledge into action as a Software Engineer at Traumasoft. My passion lies in crafting applications that genuinely enhance people's daily lives, and my ultimate goal is to push the boundaries of human innovation through code. Moreover, I'm deeply committed to diversity and inclusion in the tech industry, aspiring to inspire women and minorities to explore exciting opportunities in technology.

##### 👩‍🍳👩‍💻 But I'm not all about bits and bytes! Beyond work, I enjoy experimenting with cooking various cuisines and baking delightful treats. In my free time, I'm an avid traveler, constantly on the lookout for new cities and restaurants to discover.

##### 💪 Proficient in Python, Java, and Kotlin, I bring a strong engineering background and expertise in back-end technologies and databases. I'm well-versed in React, PHP, Django, Figma, and more.

##### 📫 I firmly believe in the power of connections and shared experiences. I invite you to connect with me on LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com/in/ayushi-2103 – I'm always eager to hear your story, exchange insights, and explore how we can learn from one another to create a brighter tech future.
